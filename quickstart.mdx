## Install the extension

<Steps>
  <Step title="Visit the Chrome Web Store">
    Open the [SaveMate extension page](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lejgkageoahacjmljeogapbkhbfldigd) in Chrome, Edge, or Brave.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Add to Chrome">
    Click the **Add to Chrome** button and confirm the installation when prompted. The extension requests minimal permissions and all processing happens locally in your browser.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pin the extension">
    Click the puzzle piece icon in your browser toolbar, then click the pin icon next to SaveMate. This keeps the SaveMate icon visible so you can see when streams are detected.

    <Tip>Pinning the extension is optional but recommended. It makes it easy to see the detection indicator at a glance.</Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Download your first video

  <Step title="Navigate to a video">
    Go to any website that hosts video content. SaveMate works with most sites that use HLS (m3u8), MP4, or WebM streaming.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for detection">
    When SaveMate detects a video stream, the extension icon in your toolbar will light up with a blue indicator.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click the icon">
    Click the SaveMate icon to open the popup. You'll see the detected stream with options to download, cast, or save to your library.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose quality and download">
    Select your preferred video quality and format, then click **Download**. The file will save to your browser's default download location.

    <Note>Free users can download up to 720p quality. [Upgrade to Professional](/billing/plans) for 4K, 8K, and 60fps downloads.</Note>
