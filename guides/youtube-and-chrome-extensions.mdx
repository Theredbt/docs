This is the most common question we receive: **"Can SaveMate download YouTube videos?"**

The short answer is **no** — and neither can any other Chrome extension. Here's why, and what your options are.

## Why YouTube downloads don't work on Chrome

### Chrome Web Store policy

Google's [Chrome Web Store Developer Program Policies](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies) explicitly prohibit extensions that facilitate downloading content from YouTube. This applies to all extensions, not just SaveMate.

Any extension that enables YouTube downloads will be:

1. **Rejected** during the Chrome Web Store review process
2. **Removed** from the store if the functionality is discovered after publication
3. **Banned** — the developer's account may be permanently suspended

SaveMate complies with these policies to remain available on the Chrome Web Store and to protect your trust as a user.

### YouTube Terms of Service

YouTube's [Terms of Service](https://www.youtube.com/static?template=terms) prohibit downloading content unless a download button or link is provided by YouTube itself. YouTube Premium subscribers can download videos for offline viewing within the YouTube app.

### What happens if an extension tries

Extensions that attempt to bypass these restrictions are typically:

- Removed from the Chrome Web Store within days
- Unable to receive updates or security patches
- A potential security risk, as they often operate outside Google's review process

<Warning>Be cautious of extensions or websites that claim to download YouTube videos. They may contain malware, inject ads, or collect your browsing data. If an extension was removed from the Chrome Web Store, there's usually a reason.</Warning>

## What SaveMate can do

SaveMate works with **thousands of other websites** that use standard video streaming formats. Here's what SaveMate excels at:

### Supported streaming formats

| Format | Examples of sites that use it |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| **HLS (m3u8)** | News sites, educational platforms, live streams, social media |
| **DASH (mpd)** | Video hosting platforms, media sites |
| **MP4** | Direct video hosting, embedded players, course platforms |
| **WebM** | Web-native video players, open-source platforms |

### Platforms where SaveMate works well

SaveMate's universal detection works on any site that delivers video via standard streaming protocols. Common categories include:

- **Educational platforms** — Online courses, lectures, tutorials, webinars
- **News & media sites** — Video reports, documentaries, interviews
- **Social media** — Platforms that use HLS or MP4 streaming
- **Vimeo** — Full support with [enhanced detection](/guides/download-from-vimeo) for accurate quality and file size information
- **Live streams** — Record ongoing HLS live streams (Professional plan)
- **Embedded players** — Videos embedded on any website using standard formats
- **Corporate & training videos** — Internal video platforms, LMS content
- **Sports & entertainment** — Streaming sites that use HLS/DASH

<Info>SaveMate detects streams based on the **format** (HLS, DASH, MP4, WebM), not the website name. If a site delivers video using a supported format, SaveMate will detect it — regardless of what platform it is.</Info>

## YouTube alternatives for offline viewing

If you specifically need offline access to YouTube content, here are legitimate options:

### YouTube Premium

YouTube's official offline feature. Requires a YouTube Premium subscription.

- Download videos within the YouTube app (mobile and desktop)
- Downloads expire after 30 days without reconnecting
- Works on iOS, Android, and the YouTube desktop app
- Does not allow transferring downloaded files to other devices

### YouTube's built-in download button

Some YouTube videos have a download button provided by the creator. This is allowed under YouTube's terms and doesn't require Premium for select content.

### Creator-provided links

Many content creators share their videos on multiple platforms or provide direct download links in video descriptions. Check if the creator offers the video on a platform where SaveMate can detect it.

## SaveMate's approach

SaveMate is built for long-term reliability. Rather than risk removal from the Chrome Web Store by violating policies, we focus on:

- **Broad compatibility** — Working with the thousands of sites that use standard streaming formats
- **Enhanced detection** — Platform-specific detectors (like [Vimeo](/guides/download-from-vimeo)) for better quality and metadata
- **Powerful features** — Format conversion, cloud sync, Chromecast, and library management that no YouTube downloader offers
- **Trust and safety** — Remaining verified on the Chrome Web Store with full Google security review
