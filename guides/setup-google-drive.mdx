Google Drive uses OAuth 2.0 authentication, so you authorize SaveMate through your Google account without sharing your password.

## Prerequisites

- A SaveMate account with a [Professional plan](/billing/plans)
- A Google account with Google Drive storage available

## Connect Google Drive

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Cloud Sync">
    Navigate to [savemate.io/cloud-sync](https://savemate.io/cloud-sync) and sign in to your SaveMate account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Connect on Google Drive">
    Find the Google Drive card and click **Connect**. You'll be redirected to Google's authorization page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose your Google account">
    Select the Google account you want to use for cloud storage. If you have multiple accounts, choose the one with enough free space.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Grant permissions">
    Google will ask you to grant SaveMate permission to manage files in your Google Drive. SaveMate only accesses a dedicated folder — it cannot read or modify your other files.

    Click **Allow** to proceed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connection confirmed">
    You'll be redirected back to SaveMate. The Google Drive card will show a **Connected** status with a green indicator.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How uploads work

Google Drive uses a **resumable upload** protocol:

- Small files (under 100MB) upload in a single request
- Larger files use resumable sessions that automatically handle network interruptions
- If your connection drops mid-upload, it resumes from where it left off
- Uploads are chunked in 5MB segments

## Storage location

SaveMate creates a dedicated folder in your Google Drive root directory. All uploaded files are organized within this folder.

## Managing the connection

### Check connection health

Your Google Drive connection status shows on the Cloud Sync page:

- **Healthy** — OAuth token is valid and uploads work normally
- **Broken** — Token expired or was invalidated. Click **Reconnect** to re-authorize
- **Revoked** — You revoked SaveMate's access from your Google account settings. Reconnect to restore

<Tip>SaveMate proactively refreshes OAuth tokens before they expire, so you shouldn't see "Broken" status under normal conditions.</Tip>

### Disconnect

To disconnect Google Drive:

1. Go to [savemate.io/cloud-sync](https://savemate.io/cloud-sync)
2. Click the disconnect option on the Google Drive card
3. The connection is removed from SaveMate

To also revoke SaveMate's access from Google's side, visit [myaccount.google.com/permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions) and remove SaveMate.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Upload fails with permission error">
    Your OAuth token may have expired. Go to Cloud Sync, disconnect Google Drive, and reconnect.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Storage quota exceeded">
    Check your Google Drive storage at [drive.google.com/settings](https://drive.google.com/settings). Free Google accounts include 15GB shared across Drive, Gmail, and Photos. Consider upgrading your Google storage or switching to a different provider.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Connection shows as broken">
    This typically means Google invalidated your token. This can happen if:
    - You changed your Google password
    - You revoked third-party app access in Google settings
    - Google detected unusual activity

    Click **Reconnect** to re-authorize.
