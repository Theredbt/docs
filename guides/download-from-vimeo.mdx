SaveMate includes a dedicated Vimeo detector that intercepts the player config API for accurate quality information and file sizes.

## How Vimeo detection works

Unlike generic stream detection, SaveMate's Vimeo detector:

1. **Intercepts the player config** — Captures Vimeo's internal API response to extract all available formats
2. **Shows progressive and HLS options** — Vimeo serves both direct MP4 files and adaptive HLS streams
3. **Displays accurate file sizes** — Progressive MP4 sizes are exact, not estimated
4. **Detects all quality levels** — Including qualities the Vimeo player may not expose in its UI

## Downloading a Vimeo video

<Steps>
  <Step title="Visit the Vimeo page">
    Navigate to the Vimeo video page or any site that embeds a Vimeo player.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Play the video">
    Press play to trigger the Vimeo player's API request. SaveMate intercepts this to extract video information.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click SaveMate">
    The extension icon lights up. Click it to see all available download options.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose your format">
    You'll typically see two types of options:
    - **Progressive MP4** — Direct file downloads with exact sizes. Available in multiple qualities.
    - **HLS stream** — Adaptive streaming with all quality variants.

    Progressive MP4 downloads are faster since there's no segment processing involved.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Download">
    Click **Download** on your preferred option.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Embedded Vimeo videos

SaveMate detects Vimeo videos wherever they're embedded — not just on vimeo.com. This includes:

- Course platforms (Teachable, Thinkific, Kajabi)
- Portfolio sites
- Business websites
- Learning management systems

The Vimeo detector works the same way regardless of where the player is embedded.

<Tip>If you're on a site with an embedded Vimeo player, make sure to play the video first. The detection relies on the Vimeo player API call that happens during playback initialization.</Tip>

## Quality options

| Quality | Progressive MP4 | HLS |
|---------|-----------------|-----|
| 360p | Usually available | Available |
| 480p | Usually available | Available |
| 720p | Usually available | Available |
| 1080p | Depends on uploader | Available |
| 1440p | Rare | Depends on upload |
| 4K | Rare | Depends on upload |

<Note>The available qualities depend on what the video creator uploaded. SaveMate shows everything Vimeo's API provides.</Note>
