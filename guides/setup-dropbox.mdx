Dropbox uses OAuth 2.0 authentication, so you authorize SaveMate through your Dropbox account without sharing your password.

## Prerequisites

- A SaveMate account with a [Professional plan](/billing/plans)
- A Dropbox account with storage available

## Connect Dropbox

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Cloud Sync">
    Navigate to [savemate.io/cloud-sync](https://savemate.io/cloud-sync) and sign in to your SaveMate account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Connect on Dropbox">
    Find the Dropbox card and click **Connect**. You'll be redirected to Dropbox's authorization page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign in to Dropbox">
    Log in with your Dropbox credentials if prompted.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Grant permissions">
    Dropbox will ask you to grant SaveMate permission to upload files. SaveMate only accesses a dedicated folder — it cannot read or modify your other files.

    Click **Allow** to proceed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connection confirmed">
    You'll be redirected back to SaveMate. The Dropbox card will show a **Connected** status.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How uploads work

Dropbox uses a **standard upload** protocol:

- Small files upload in a single API call
- Larger files are uploaded in 8MB chunks
- Upload progress is tracked and visible on the Cloud Sync page

## Storage location

SaveMate creates a dedicated folder within your Dropbox. All uploaded files are saved in this folder and sync across all your Dropbox-connected devices automatically.

## Managing the connection

### Check connection health

- **Healthy** — OAuth token is valid
- **Broken** — Token expired. Click **Reconnect** to re-authorize
- **Revoked** — Access was removed from Dropbox settings. Reconnect to restore

### Disconnect

1. Go to [savemate.io/cloud-sync](https://savemate.io/cloud-sync)
2. Click disconnect on the Dropbox card

To also revoke from Dropbox's side, visit [dropbox.com/account/connected_apps](https://www.dropbox.com/account/connected_apps) and remove SaveMate.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Upload stuck or slow">
    Dropbox has rate limits on API uploads. If you're uploading many files in quick succession, some may queue. Wait a few minutes and retry.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Storage quota exceeded">
    Check your available space at [dropbox.com/account](https://www.dropbox.com/account). Free Dropbox accounts include 2GB. Consider upgrading or switching to a different cloud provider.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Connection shows as broken">
    Re-authorize by clicking **Reconnect** on the Cloud Sync page. This typically resolves token expiry issues.
