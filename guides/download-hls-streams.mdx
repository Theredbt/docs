HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) is the most common adaptive streaming format on the web. SaveMate can detect, download, and convert HLS streams automatically.

## What is HLS?

HLS is a streaming method where video is split into many small pieces instead of delivered as a single file. This is what allows sites to offer multiple quality levels and switch between them based on your connection speed.

SaveMate handles all this complexity for you. It downloads all the pieces at once and combines them into a single video file.

## How to download an HLS stream

<Steps>
  <Step title="Visit the page">
    Navigate to any site that uses HLS streaming. Most video platforms, news sites, and educational platforms use HLS.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Play the video">
    Some sites only load the HLS manifest when you press play. Start the video to trigger stream detection.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click the SaveMate icon">
    When the icon lights up, click it to see the detected stream with all available quality variants.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select quality">
    Choose from the available quality levels. HLS streams typically offer multiple options (360p, 480p, 720p, 1080p, etc.).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Download">
    Click **Download**. SaveMate downloads all segments in parallel and combines them into a single file.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Converting HLS to MP4

By default, HLS streams download in their native format (.ts files). With the Professional plan, you can convert to standard formats that work on all devices:

| Target | Use case |
|--------|----------|
| **MP4** | Universal playback on any device or player |
| **MKV** | Preserve multiple audio tracks and subtitles |
| **MOV** | Apple ecosystem and professional editing |
| **WebM** | Web embedding and open-source workflows |

Conversion happens locally in your browser — no data is uploaded to any server.

<Info>Format conversion is a [Professional feature](/billing/plans). Free users download HLS streams in their native .ts format, which can be played in VLC and most modern media players.</Info>

## Live stream recording

SaveMate can record ongoing live HLS streams. When you detect a live stream:

1. Click **Download** to start recording
2. SaveMate captures segments as they become available
3. Stop the recording when you're done
4. The recorded segments are combined into a single file

<Note>Live stream recording is available on the Professional plan. Session duration is limited by your browser tab staying open.</Note>

## Separate audio and video tracks

Many HLS streams deliver audio and video as separate tracks. SaveMate automatically detects both, downloads them together, and combines them into a single file. No manual merging required.

## Tips for HLS downloads

- **Refresh if not detected** — Some streams load lazily. Refresh the page and play the video to trigger detection
- **Check all quality options** — SaveMate often finds more quality levels than the video player shows
- **Large files** — Long streams (movies, lectures) can be several GB. Make sure you have enough disk space
- **File size previews** — SaveMate estimates the file size before you download so you know what to expect
