HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) is the most common adaptive streaming format on the web. SaveMate can detect, download, and convert HLS streams automatically.

## What is HLS?

HLS streams use `.m3u8` manifest files that point to many small video segments. Instead of a single video file, the stream is broken into chunks that the browser downloads sequentially. This is what makes adaptive quality possible — the player can switch between quality levels mid-stream.

SaveMate handles all this complexity for you. It parses the manifest, downloads all segments concurrently, and combines them into a single video file.

## How to download an HLS stream

<Steps>
  <Step title="Visit the page">
    Navigate to any site that uses HLS streaming. Most video platforms, news sites, and educational platforms use HLS.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Play the video">
    Some sites only load the HLS manifest when you press play. Start the video to trigger stream detection.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click the SaveMate icon">
    When the icon lights up, click it to see the detected stream with all available quality variants.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select quality">
    Choose from the available quality levels. HLS streams typically offer multiple options (360p, 480p, 720p, 1080p, etc.).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Download">
    Click **Download**. SaveMate downloads all segments in parallel and combines them into a single file.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Converting HLS to MP4

By default, HLS segments download in their native container format (usually MPEG-TS). With the Professional plan, you can convert to standard formats:

| Target | Use case |
|--------|----------|
| **MP4** | Universal playback on any device or player |
| **MKV** | Preserve multiple audio tracks and subtitles |
| **MOV** | Apple ecosystem and professional editing |
| **WebM** | Web embedding and open-source workflows |

Conversion happens locally in your browser — no data is uploaded to any server.

<Info>Format conversion is a [Professional feature](/billing/plans). Free users download HLS streams in their native MPEG-TS format.</Info>

## Live stream recording

SaveMate can record ongoing live HLS streams. When you detect a live stream:

1. Click **Download** to start recording
2. SaveMate captures segments as they become available
3. Stop the recording when you're done
4. The recorded segments are combined into a single file

<Note>Live stream recording is available on the Professional plan. Session duration is limited by your browser tab staying open.</Note>

## Separate audio and video tracks

Many HLS streams deliver audio and video as separate tracks. SaveMate automatically detects both, downloads them in parallel, and muxes them into a single output file. No manual merging required.

## Tips for HLS downloads

- **Refresh if not detected** — Some streams load lazily. Refresh the page and play the video to trigger detection
- **Check all quality options** — HLS manifests often include more quality levels than the player UI shows
- **Large files** — Long HLS streams (movies, lectures) can be several GB. Make sure you have enough disk space
- **Bandwidth estimates** — SaveMate samples stream bandwidth to estimate file sizes before download
