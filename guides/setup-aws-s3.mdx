AWS S3 uses API key authentication. You'll need to create an IAM user with the right permissions and provide your credentials to SaveMate.

## Prerequisites

- A SaveMate account with a [Professional plan](/billing/plans)
- An AWS account with an S3 bucket
- An IAM user with S3 write permissions

## Step 1: Create an S3 bucket

If you don't already have a bucket:

1. Sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)
2. Click **Create bucket**
3. Enter a bucket name (e.g., `my-savemate-videos`)
4. Choose a region close to you for faster uploads
5. Leave other settings as default and click **Create bucket**

## Step 2: Create an IAM user

SaveMate needs an IAM user with limited permissions to upload files:

1. Go to the [IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)
2. Navigate to **Users** and click **Create user**
3. Enter a username (e.g., `savemate-uploader`)
4. Select **Attach policies directly**
5. Create and attach a custom policy with these permissions:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:CreateMultipartUpload",
        "s3:UploadPart",
        "s3:CompleteMultipartUpload",
        "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
        "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Replace `YOUR-BUCKET-NAME` with your actual bucket name.

<Warning>Only grant the minimum permissions listed above. Do not use `s3:*` or attach the `AmazonS3FullAccess` policy.</Warning>

## Step 3: Generate access keys

1. In the IAM Console, click on your new user
2. Go to the **Security credentials** tab
3. Under **Access keys**, click **Create access key**
4. Select **Third-party service** as the use case
5. Copy both the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**

<Warning>The Secret Access Key is only shown once. Save it securely before closing the dialog.</Warning>

## Step 4: Connect in SaveMate

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Cloud Sync">
    Navigate to [savemate.io/cloud-sync](https://savemate.io/cloud-sync) and sign in.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Connect on AWS S3">
    Find the AWS S3 card and click **Connect**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter your credentials">
    Fill in the connection form:
    - **Access Key ID** — Your IAM user's access key
    - **Secret Access Key** — Your IAM user's secret key
    - **Bucket name** — Your S3 bucket name
    - **Region** — The AWS region where your bucket is located
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test and save">
    SaveMate validates the credentials by attempting a test upload. If successful, the connection is saved.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How uploads work

S3 uses **multipart upload** for files over 100MB:

- Files are split into 10MB parts
- Parts upload in parallel for maximum speed
- Uploads can be **paused and resumed** at any time
- Supports files up to 50TB
- Failed parts are automatically retried

For files under 100MB, SaveMate uses a direct single-request upload via presigned URLs.

## Managing the connection

### Update credentials

If you rotate your IAM access keys:

1. Generate new keys in the IAM Console
2. Go to Cloud Sync settings in SaveMate
3. Update the credentials on the S3 card

### Disconnect

Click disconnect on the S3 card to remove the connection. Your bucket and files are not affected — only the SaveMate connection is removed.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Access denied error">
    Verify that your IAM policy includes all required actions (`PutObject`, `CreateMultipartUpload`, `UploadPart`, `CompleteMultipartUpload`, `AbortMultipartUpload`, `ListMultipartUploadParts`) and that the Resource ARN matches your bucket name.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Wrong region error">
    S3 bucket names are globally unique but buckets exist in specific regions. Make sure the region in SaveMate matches where your bucket was created.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Upload timeout">
    Large file uploads over slow connections can time out. Try:
    - Using a more stable connection
    - Pausing and resuming the upload to reset the connection
    - Checking if your S3 bucket has any lifecycle policies that might interfere
