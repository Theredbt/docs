SaveMate's options page lets you customize how the extension detects, downloads, and manages video streams.

To open settings, right-click the SaveMate icon in your toolbar and select **Options**, or click the gear icon in the extension popup.

## Format Options

Control which video and audio formats SaveMate detects as you browse.

### Video formats

Toggle detection for each video container format:

| Format | Default |
|--------|---------|
| MP4 (.mp4, .m4v) | Enabled |
| WebM (.webm) | Enabled |
| MKV (.mkv) | Enabled |
| MOV (.mov) | Enabled |
| TS (.ts, .m2ts, .mts) | Enabled |
| AVI (.avi) | Enabled |
| OGG (.ogg) | Enabled |
| MPEG (.mpg) | Enabled |
| WMV (.wmv) | Enabled |
| FLV (.flv) | Enabled |
| 3GP (.3gp) | Enabled |

### Audio formats

Toggle detection for standalone audio streams:

| Format | Default |
|--------|---------|
| MP3 (.mp3) | Enabled |
| AAC (.aac) | Enabled |
| M4A (.m4a) | Enabled |
| FLAC (.flac) | Enabled |
| WAV (.wav) | Enabled |

<Tip>Disabling formats you don't need reduces noise in the popup when browsing media-heavy sites.</Tip>

## Minimum File Size

Filter out small media files that are typically ads, icons, or UI sounds rather than actual video content.

| Preset | Best for |
|--------|----------|
| **10 KB** | Catch almost everything, including small audio clips |
| **100 KB** | Filter out tiny files while keeping short clips |
| **1 MB** | Standard — filters ads and small UI media (recommended) |
| **2 MB** | Only show substantial video files |
| **Custom** | Enter any value in MB for precise control |

<Info>The minimum file size filter applies to progressive downloads where the file size is known from HTTP headers. HLS and DASH streams are always shown regardless of this setting.</Info>

## Download Settings

### Download management

When enabled, SaveMate uses the browser's download API for better control over file naming and save location. This requires an optional browser permission that is requested when you toggle it on.

**Enabled:** Files are saved through the browser's download manager with proper file names and your chosen download path.

**Disabled:** Files are saved using the default browser save dialog.

### Download path

Set a folder prefix for all SaveMate downloads. For example, setting this to `SaveMate/` saves all files into a `SaveMate` subfolder within your browser's default download directory.

<Note>The download path setting only appears when download management is enabled.</Note>

## Chromecast

Toggle Chromecast and AirPlay casting support. When enabled, a **Cast** button appears alongside download options for detected streams.

Disabling this removes the cast option from the popup to simplify the interface if you don't use casting.

## Website Controls

Block specific domains from stream detection. When a site is blocked, SaveMate won't monitor network activity or show the detection indicator on that domain.

### Adding blocked sites

1. Enter a domain (e.g., `example.com`) in the input field
2. Click **Add** or press Enter
3. The domain and all its subdomains will be excluded from detection

### Removing blocked sites

Click the **X** button next to any blocked domain to re-enable detection on that site.

<Tip>Block sites where SaveMate detects unwanted media (like video ads on news sites) to keep your popup clean.</Tip>

## Saving settings

Changes are not applied automatically. After adjusting any settings:

1. A **Save** button appears at the bottom of the page
2. Click **Save** to apply your changes
3. A confirmation toast appears when settings are saved successfully

Settings sync across browser profiles if you're signed into Chrome sync.
