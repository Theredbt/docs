## Browser compatibility

SaveMate v2.0 is built on Manifest V3 and supports all major Chromium-based browsers on desktop.

| Browser | Platform | Status | Notes |
|---------|----------|--------|-------|
| Google Chrome | macOS, Windows, Linux | Fully supported | Recommended for best performance |
| Microsoft Edge | macOS, Windows, Linux | Fully supported | Install via Chrome Web Store |
| Brave | macOS, Windows, Linux | Fully supported | Privacy-focused, fully compatible |
| Mozilla Firefox | macOS, Windows, Linux | Coming soon | In development |

## Operating system support

SaveMate works on all desktop operating systems:

- **macOS** — 10.15 (Catalina) and later
- **Windows** — Windows 10 and later
- **Linux** — Any distribution that runs a supported browser

## Mobile support

Browser extensions are a desktop-only feature. SaveMate cannot be installed on mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome).

## Minimum browser versions

SaveMate requires Manifest V3 support:

- Chrome 88+
- Edge 88+
- Brave 1.20+

If you're running an older browser version, update to the latest version for full compatibility.

## Language support

SaveMate is available in the following languages:

- English
- French (Fran&ccedil;ais)
- Arabic (العربية)

The extension automatically uses your browser's language setting.

## Extension permissions

SaveMate requests the following permissions during installation:

| Permission | Why it's needed |
|------------|----------------|
| **Read and change all your data on all websites** | Required to monitor network requests for video stream detection on any site you visit |
| **Manage your downloads** (optional) | Requested at runtime if you enable download management in settings. Provides better control over file naming and save location |

<Info>
  SaveMate uses the `declarativeNetRequest` API for downloads and `webRequest` for stream detection. All processing is local — no browsing data is sent anywhere.
</Info>

## Why Chromium only?

SaveMate uses Manifest V3 Chromium extension APIs including:

- **`webRequest`** — Real-time network monitoring for stream detection
- **`declarativeNetRequest`** — Dynamic download rules for file saving
- **`storage.sync`** — Settings synchronization across devices
- **Background service worker** — Efficient background processing

These APIs provide the best performance and reliability for real-time video stream detection. Firefox support using the WebExtension API is in development.
