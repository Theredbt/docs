## Browser compatibility

SaveMate is built for Chromium-based browsers and supports all major desktop platforms.

| Browser | Platform | Status | Notes |
|---------|----------|--------|-------|
| Google Chrome | macOS, Windows, Linux | Fully supported | Recommended for best performance |
| Microsoft Edge | macOS, Windows, Linux | Fully supported | Install via Chrome Web Store |
| Brave | macOS, Windows, Linux | Fully supported | Privacy-focused, fully compatible |
| Mozilla Firefox | macOS, Windows, Linux | Coming soon | In development |

## Operating system support

SaveMate works on all desktop operating systems:

- **macOS** — 10.15 (Catalina) and later
- **Windows** — Windows 10 and later
- **Linux** — Any distribution that runs a supported browser

## Mobile support

Browser extensions are a desktop-only feature. SaveMate cannot be installed on mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome).

However, if you have a SaveMate account with cloud library enabled, you can access your saved videos from any device through the [SaveMate web app](https://savemate.io/videos).

## Minimum browser versions

- Chrome 88+
- Edge 88+
- Brave 1.20+

If you're running an older browser version, update to the latest version for full compatibility.

## Why Chromium only?

SaveMate uses Chromium extension APIs for stream detection, content scripts, and background processing. These APIs provide the best performance and reliability for real-time video stream detection.

Firefox support is in development and will use the WebExtension API when available.
