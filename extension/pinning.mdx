Pinning SaveMate to your toolbar keeps the extension icon always visible, so you can immediately see when a video stream is detected on the current page.

## How to pin SaveMate

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the extensions menu">
    Click the **puzzle piece icon** in the top-right corner of your browser toolbar. This opens the extensions menu showing all installed extensions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find SaveMate">
    Locate **SaveMate** in the list of extensions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click the pin icon">
    Click the **pin icon** next to SaveMate. It will turn blue, indicating that the extension is now pinned to your toolbar.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why pin the extension?

When pinned, the SaveMate icon provides visual feedback:

- **Inactive** — The icon appears in its default state when no streams are detected on the current page
- **Active** — The icon lights up with a blue indicator when one or more video streams are detected

Without pinning, you'd need to open the extensions menu each time to check for detected streams.
