## Stream not detected

**The SaveMate icon doesn't light up on a page with video.**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check the stream format">
    SaveMate detects HLS (m3u8), MP4, and WebM streams. Some sites use proprietary DRM-protected streams that cannot be detected.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Refresh the page">
    Stream detection starts when the page loads. Try refreshing the page to trigger detection again.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Play the video">
    Some sites only load the video stream when you press play. Start playing the video and wait a few seconds for detection.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check the extension is enabled">
    Right-click the SaveMate icon and select **Manage extension**. Make sure the extension is toggled **On**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Download fails or is incomplete

**The download starts but doesn't complete, or the downloaded file is corrupted.**

- **Check your internet connection** — Unstable connections can interrupt HLS segment downloads
- **Try a different quality** — Lower quality streams have smaller segments and are more reliable on slow connections
- **Retry the download** — SaveMate supports resuming interrupted HLS downloads
- **Clear browser cache** — Cached manifest data can sometimes cause issues. Clear your cache and refresh the page
- **Check disk space** — Make sure you have enough free storage for the video file

## Extension not appearing in toolbar

**You installed SaveMate but can't find it in your browser.**

The extension may be installed but not pinned to your toolbar:

1. Click the **puzzle piece icon** in the top-right of your browser toolbar
2. Find SaveMate in the extension list
3. Click the **pin icon** to keep it visible

See the [Pin to Toolbar guide](/extension/pinning) for detailed instructions.

## Cloud sync issues

**Uploads to cloud storage fail or don't start.**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Google Drive / Dropbox">
    - **Re-authorize**: Your OAuth token may have expired. Go to Cloud Sync settings, disconnect the provider, and reconnect
    - **Check permissions**: Make sure you granted SaveMate the required permissions during OAuth authorization
    - **Storage quota**: Check that your cloud storage account has enough free space
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="AWS S3 / Cloudflare R2">
    - **Verify credentials**: Double-check your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key
    - **Bucket permissions**: Ensure your IAM user/policy has `s3:PutObject` and `s3:CreateMultipartUpload` permissions
    - **Region**: Confirm the correct region is configured for your S3 bucket
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Account issues

### Can't verify email

If you didn't receive the verification email:

1. Check your spam/junk folder
2. Go to [savemate.io/email/verify](https://savemate.io/email/verify) and click **Resend verification email**
3. If using a work email, check with your IT department about email filters

### Forgot password

1. Go to [savemate.io/forgot-password](https://savemate.io/forgot-password)
2. Enter your email address
3. Check your inbox for the reset link
4. Click the link and set a new password

### 2FA lockout

If you've lost access to your authenticator app:

1. Use one of your saved recovery codes to log in
2. Once logged in, disable and re-enable 2FA with a new device

If you've also lost your recovery codes, contact support for account recovery assistance.

## Download limit reached

**You see a message that you've reached your daily download limit.**

Free users can download unlimited videos at 720p and below, but HD downloads (1080p and above) are limited to 3 per day.

- **The limit resets at midnight** — Wait until the next day for your HD downloads to reset
- **The limit is tracked per device** — Using a different browser or device won't reset the limit if you're logged in, as it's tied to your account
- **Lower quality downloads are unlimited** — You can still download at 720p and below without any limit
- **Upgrade to Professional** — [Professional plans](/billing/plans) include unlimited HD downloads with no daily cap

<Tip>If you frequently need HD downloads, consider the [lifetime access](/billing/lifetime) option for a one-time payment with no recurring charges.</Tip>

## Cloud upload stuck

**An upload to cloud storage shows as "uploading" but doesn't progress.**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Check connection health">
    Go to [savemate.io/cloud-sync](https://savemate.io/cloud-sync) and check the status indicator on your provider card:
    - **Healthy** (green) — Connection is working. The issue may be network-related.
    - **Broken** (yellow) — Your OAuth token expired. Click **Reconnect** to re-authorize.
    - **Revoked** (red) — Access was removed from the provider side. Reconnect with new authorization.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Pause and resume">
    For multipart uploads (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2), try pausing the upload and resuming it. This creates a fresh connection while preserving already-uploaded parts.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Check your cloud storage quota">
    Make sure your cloud storage account has enough free space. Google Drive shares its 15GB quota with Gmail and Google Photos.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Retry failed uploads">
    If an upload failed, you can retry it from the upload history on the Cloud Sync page. Click the retry button next to the failed upload.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Payment issues

**A subscription payment failed or you can't complete checkout.**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Payment method declined">
    1. Go to your [billing dashboard](https://savemate.io/billing)
    2. Update your payment method with a valid card
    3. Retry the payment

    Common reasons for decline: insufficient funds, expired card, bank fraud protection. Contact your bank if the card should be working.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Invoice payment failed">
    Failed invoices can be retried from your billing dashboard. SaveMate will also automatically retry failed payments after a short delay.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Subscription not activating after payment">
    Webhook processing can occasionally take a few minutes. If your Professional features don't activate within 5 minutes of payment, try:
    1. Refreshing the page
    2. Logging out and back in
    3. Contacting support if the issue persists
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Extension doesn't detect videos on SPA sites

**SaveMate doesn't detect videos when navigating between pages on single-page applications.**

SaveMate includes an SPA observer that detects navigation changes on React, Vue, and Angular sites. If detection isn't working:

1. **Play the video** — Some SPAs don't load streams until playback starts
2. **Wait a few seconds** — SPA navigation detection has a brief delay while the new content loads
3. **Try a full page refresh** — Press F5 or Ctrl+R to force a complete reload, which triggers fresh detection
4. **Check blocked sites** — Make sure the domain isn't in your [blocked sites list](/extension/settings#website-controls)
