## Stream not detected

**The SaveMate icon doesn't light up on a page with video.**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check the stream format">
    SaveMate detects HLS (m3u8), MP4, and WebM streams. Some sites use proprietary DRM-protected streams that cannot be detected.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Refresh the page">
    Stream detection starts when the page loads. Try refreshing the page to trigger detection again.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Play the video">
    Some sites only load the video stream when you press play. Start playing the video and wait a few seconds for detection.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check the extension is enabled">
    Right-click the SaveMate icon and select **Manage extension**. Make sure the extension is toggled **On**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Download fails or is incomplete

**The download starts but doesn't complete, or the downloaded file is corrupted.**

- **Check your internet connection** — Unstable connections can interrupt HLS segment downloads
- **Try a different quality** — Lower quality streams have smaller segments and are more reliable on slow connections
- **Retry the download** — SaveMate supports resuming interrupted HLS downloads
- **Clear browser cache** — Cached manifest data can sometimes cause issues. Clear your cache and refresh the page
- **Check disk space** — Make sure you have enough free storage for the video file

## Extension not appearing in toolbar

**You installed SaveMate but can't find it in your browser.**

The extension may be installed but not pinned to your toolbar:

1. Click the **puzzle piece icon** in the top-right of your browser toolbar
2. Find SaveMate in the extension list
3. Click the **pin icon** to keep it visible

See the [Pin to Toolbar guide](/extension/pinning) for detailed instructions.
