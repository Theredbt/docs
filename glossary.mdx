## Streaming & Video

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)">
    An adaptive streaming protocol developed by Apple. HLS breaks video into small segments listed in a `.m3u8` manifest file. The player downloads segments sequentially, and can switch between quality levels based on network conditions. HLS is the most common streaming format on the web.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP)">
    An adaptive streaming protocol similar to HLS, using `.mpd` (Media Presentation Description) manifest files. DASH is an open standard used by many modern video platforms as an alternative to HLS.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="m3u8">
    The file extension for HLS manifest files. An m3u8 file is a text-based playlist that lists the URLs of video segments and their metadata. When SaveMate detects an m3u8 file, it means an HLS stream has been found.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="MPD (Media Presentation Description)">
    The file format used by DASH streams. Similar to m3u8 for HLS, an MPD file describes available video qualities and audio tracks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Adaptive bitrate streaming">
    A technique where video is encoded at multiple quality levels. The player automatically switches between qualities based on your internet speed, ensuring smooth playback. Both HLS and DASH use adaptive bitrate streaming.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Progressive download">
    A direct video file download (e.g., a single MP4 file) as opposed to segmented streaming. The browser downloads the file from start to finish. File size is usually known upfront.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Segments">
    Small chunks of video (typically 2-10 seconds each) that make up an HLS or DASH stream. SaveMate downloads all segments and combines them into a single continuous file.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Manifest">
    A file that describes the structure of an adaptive stream. HLS uses m3u8 manifests, DASH uses MPD manifests. The manifest lists available qualities, segment URLs, and audio/video track information.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Muxing">
    The process of combining separate audio and video streams into a single file. Many HLS/DASH streams deliver audio and video separately, and SaveMate automatically muxes them during download.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Container format">
    A file format that wraps video and audio data together. Common containers include MP4, MKV, MOV, and WebM. Different containers support different codecs and features (like subtitles or multiple audio tracks).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Codec">
    The algorithm used to encode and decode video or audio data. Common video codecs include H.264, H.265, VP9, and AV1. The codec determines quality and file size, while the container format determines the file extension.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Transcoding vs. transmuxing">
    **Transmuxing** changes the container format without re-encoding (fast, no quality loss). **Transcoding** re-encodes the video with a different codec (slow, potential quality change). SaveMate transmuxes when possible to preserve quality.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## File Formats

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="MP4 (.mp4)">
    The most widely supported video container format. Works on virtually every device, browser, and media player. Uses H.264 or H.265 codecs. The default choice for most users.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="MKV (.mkv)">
    Matroska Video — an open container format that supports multiple audio tracks, subtitles, and rich metadata in a single file. Popular for archiving and media server use.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="WebM (.webm)">
    An open video format developed by Google, typically using VP9 or AV1 codecs. Common on web platforms and produces smaller files than MP4 at similar quality. Best for web embedding.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="MOV (.mov)">
    Apple's video container format, native to macOS and iOS. Preferred for Apple ecosystem workflows and professional video editing with Final Cut Pro.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="MPEG-TS (.ts)">
    Transport Stream — the native segment format used by HLS streams. When downloading HLS without conversion, you get a .ts file. Can be converted to MP4, MKV, or other formats.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Cloud Storage

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="OAuth 2.0">
    An authorization protocol that lets you grant SaveMate access to your cloud storage without sharing your password. Used by Google Drive and Dropbox. You can revoke access at any time from the provider's settings.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Multipart upload">
    A method for uploading large files by splitting them into smaller parts that upload in parallel. Used by AWS S3 and Cloudflare R2 for files over 100MB. Supports pause/resume and handles network interruptions gracefully.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Resumable upload">
    An upload method that can automatically recover from network interruptions without restarting from scratch. Used by Google Drive. If your connection drops, the upload resumes from where it left off.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Egress fees">
    Charges for downloading data from cloud storage. AWS S3 charges egress fees when you access your files, while Cloudflare R2 does not — a key cost advantage if you frequently access your uploaded videos.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Browser & Web

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="SPA (Single-Page Application)">
    A modern type of website that updates content without reloading the full page (think Gmail, Twitter, or most React/Vue apps). SaveMate includes special support for SPAs to re-detect videos when you navigate between pages.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="DRM (Digital Rights Management)">
    Copy protection technology used by some streaming services to prevent downloading. SaveMate cannot detect or download DRM-protected content. Sites that use DRM include most major subscription streaming services.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
