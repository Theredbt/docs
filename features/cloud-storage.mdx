## Upload methods

### Direct upload (files under 100MB)

For smaller files, SaveMate uploads directly from your browser to the cloud provider. This is fast and requires no intermediate storage.

### Multipart upload (files over 100MB)

For larger files (AWS S3 and Cloudflare R2), SaveMate uses multipart upload:

- Files are split into smaller chunks
- Chunks upload in parallel for maximum speed
- Uploads can be **paused and resumed**
- Supports files up to 50TB

### Resumable upload (Google Drive)

Google Drive uses its resumable upload protocol, which automatically handles network interruptions and retries.

## Upload history

Track all your cloud uploads from the Cloud Sync page:

- **Status filters** — View all, completed, failed, or cancelled uploads
- **File details** — Name, provider, size, and upload date
- **Direct links** — Click through to view the file in your cloud storage
- **Retry failed uploads** — Re-attempt uploads that failed due to network issues

## Managing connections

You can manage your cloud connections from the Cloud Sync settings:

- **Update credentials** — Refresh OAuth tokens or update API keys
- **Disconnect** — Remove a provider and revoke access
- **Request a provider** — Suggest new cloud storage providers for SaveMate to support
