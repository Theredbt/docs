<Info>Format conversion is a **Professional** feature. [Upgrade your plan](/billing/plans) to access it.</Info>

SaveMate can convert HLS (m3u8) and DASH (mpd) streams into standard video container formats, and extract audio tracks into common audio formats.

## Video format conversion

Convert detected HLS and DASH streams to any of these formats:

| Target format | Best for |
|--------------|----------|
| **MP4** | Universal compatibility — works on all devices, browsers, and media players |
| **MKV** | Multiple audio tracks, subtitles, and metadata-rich video files |
| **MOV** | Apple ecosystem, Final Cut Pro, and professional video editing |
| **WebM** | Web embedding, open-source workflows |

## Audio extraction

Extract audio from video streams into standalone audio files:

| Target format | Best for |
|--------------|----------|
| **MP3** | Universal audio compatibility, music players, podcasts |
| **AAC** | Higher quality at lower bitrates, Apple ecosystem |

## How conversion works

## Format comparison

Use this table to choose the right format for your use case:

| | MP4 | MKV | MOV | WebM |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Device compatibility** | Universal | Good (VLC, most players) | Apple ecosystem | Browsers, Linux |
| **Multiple audio tracks** | Limited | Excellent | Good | Limited |
| **Subtitle support** | Basic | Excellent (multiple formats) | Good | Basic (WebVTT) |
| **File size** | Medium | Medium | Medium-Large | Smaller |
| **Streaming friendly** | Excellent | Poor | Good | Good |
| **Professional editing** | Good | Limited | Excellent (Final Cut) | Limited |
| **Web embedding** | Good | Not recommended | Not recommended | Excellent |

### When to use each format

- **MP4** — Default choice. Works everywhere. Best for sharing, mobile playback, and general use.
- **MKV** — Best for archiving. Supports multiple audio tracks (different languages), many subtitle formats, and rich metadata. Ideal for media servers like Plex or Jellyfin.
- **MOV** — Choose this for editing in Final Cut Pro or if you primarily use Apple devices.
- **WebM** — Smallest file size for web use. Choose this for embedding on websites or if you prefer open formats.

### Audio format comparison

| | MP3 | AAC |
|---|---|---|
| **Compatibility** | Universal | Very wide (all modern devices) |
| **Quality at low bitrates** | Adequate | Better |
| **File size** | Larger | Smaller at same quality |
| **Best for** | Maximum compatibility | Higher quality, Apple ecosystem |

## Key details

- **All processing is local** — Conversion happens in your browser using efficient WebAssembly code. Your video data never leaves your device.
- **Quality preservation** — SaveMate converts container formats without re-encoding, so there's no quality loss for compatible codec combinations.
- **Separate audio/video** — When an HLS or DASH stream has separate audio and video tracks, SaveMate automatically muxes them into a single output file.
- **DASH SegmentBase detection** — For DASH streams using SegmentBase (direct MP4), SaveMate downloads the file directly without conversion overhead.
