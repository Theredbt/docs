SaveMate can convert HLS (m3u8) and DASH (mpd) streams into standard video container formats, and extract audio tracks into common audio formats.

## Video format conversion

Convert detected HLS and DASH streams to any of these formats:

| Target format | Best for |
|--------------|----------|
| **MP4** | Universal compatibility — works on all devices, browsers, and media players |
| **MKV** | Multiple audio tracks, subtitles, and metadata-rich video files |
| **MOV** | Apple ecosystem, Final Cut Pro, and professional video editing |
| **WebM** | Web embedding, open-source workflows |

## Audio extraction

Extract audio from video streams into standalone audio files:

| Target format | Best for |
|--------------|----------|
| **MP3** | Universal audio compatibility, music players, podcasts |
| **AAC** | Higher quality at lower bitrates, Apple ecosystem |

## How conversion works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Detect and download">
    SaveMate detects the HLS or DASH stream and downloads all video/audio segments.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select target format">
    Choose your desired output format from the format picker.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Local processing">
    SaveMate converts the stream locally in your browser using WebAssembly-based processing. No data is uploaded to any server.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save the result">
    The converted file is saved to your downloads folder.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key details

- **All processing is local** — Conversion happens in your browser using efficient WebAssembly code. Your video data never leaves your device.
- **Quality preservation** — SaveMate converts container formats without re-encoding, so there's no quality loss for compatible codec combinations.
- **Separate audio/video** — When an HLS or DASH stream has separate audio and video tracks, SaveMate automatically muxes them into a single output file.
- **DASH SegmentBase detection** — For DASH streams using SegmentBase (direct MP4), SaveMate downloads the file directly without conversion overhead.
