SaveMate's core feature is universal stream detection. As you browse the web, SaveMate monitors network activity for video streams and notifies you when one is found.

## How it works

1. **Passive monitoring** — SaveMate listens for network requests that match known video stream patterns (HLS manifests, MP4 files, WebM files)
2. **Stream identification** — When a matching request is detected, SaveMate parses the stream metadata (title, quality, duration)
3. **Visual notification** — The extension icon lights up to indicate a stream is available
4. **User action** — You click the icon to view stream details and choose what to do (download, cast, save)

All detection happens locally in your browser. No data is sent to external servers.

## Supported stream types

| Type | Format | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **HLS** | `.m3u8` | HTTP Live Streaming — the most common adaptive streaming format. Used by most video platforms. |
| **MP4** | `.mp4` | Direct MP4 video files served over HTTP. |
| **WebM** | `.webm` | WebM video format, commonly used on web platforms. |

## Detection indicator

The SaveMate extension icon provides real-time feedback:

- **Default state** — No streams detected on the current page
- **Active (blue)** — One or more video streams have been detected

Click the icon when it's active to see all detected streams and their details.

## Stream metadata

When a stream is detected, SaveMate extracts and displays:

- **Title** — The video title from the page or stream metadata
- **Thumbnail** — A preview image when available
- **Quality** — Available quality levels (480p, 720p, 1080p, 4K, etc.)
- **Duration** — Video length when available
- **Source URL** — The originating page
