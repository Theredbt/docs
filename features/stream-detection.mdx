SaveMate's core feature is universal stream detection. As you browse the web, SaveMate monitors network activity for video streams and notifies you when one is found.

## How it works

1. **Passive monitoring** — SaveMate listens for HTTP responses that match known video stream patterns via the browser's network APIs
2. **Stream identification** — When a match is found, SaveMate parses the stream metadata (title, quality, duration, file size)
3. **Visual notification** — The extension icon lights up with a blue indicator
4. **User action** — Click the icon to view stream details and choose what to do (download, cast, save)

All detection happens locally in your browser. No data is sent to external servers.

## Supported stream types

### Adaptive streaming

| Type | Format | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **HLS** | `.m3u8` | HTTP Live Streaming — the most common adaptive streaming format. SaveMate parses master manifests, extracts all quality variants, and detects separate audio tracks. |
| **DASH** | `.mpd` | Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP — used by many modern video platforms. SaveMate parses MPD manifests to extract available qualities and bandwidth information. |

### Progressive video

SaveMate detects direct video files served over HTTP in 16 formats:

| Format | Extensions |
|--------|-----------|
| **MP4** | `.mp4`, `.m4v` |
| **WebM** | `.webm` |
| **MKV** | `.mkv` |
| **MOV** | `.mov` |
| **Transport Stream** | `.ts`, `.m2ts`, `.mts` |
| **AVI** | `.avi` |
| **OGG** | `.ogg` |
| **MPEG** | `.mpg` |
| **WMV** | `.wmv` |
| **Flash Video** | `.flv` |
| **3GP** | `.3gp` |

### Audio formats

SaveMate can also detect standalone audio streams:

`.mp3`, `.aac`, `.m4a`, `.flac`, `.wav`

### Platform-specific detection

SaveMate includes enhanced detection for specific platforms:

- **Vimeo** — Intercepts player config API to extract both progressive MP4 files and HLS playlists with accurate file sizes

## Detection indicator

The SaveMate extension icon provides real-time feedback:

- **Default state** — No streams detected on the current page
- **Active (blue)** — One or more video streams have been detected

Click the icon when it's active to see all detected streams, grouped by quality variant.

## Stream metadata

When a stream is detected, SaveMate extracts and displays:

- **Title** — The video title from the page or stream metadata
- **Thumbnail** — A preview image extracted from the page
- **Quality** — Available quality levels (480p, 720p, 1080p, 4K, 8K, etc.)
- **File size** — Estimated or exact file size (from `Content-Length` headers or bandwidth calculations)
- **Duration** — Video length when available (sampled from manifest variants)
- **Source URL** — The originating page

<Tip>
  File sizes for progressive videos are extracted from HTTP headers. For HLS and DASH streams, SaveMate calculates estimated sizes from the stream's bandwidth and duration.
