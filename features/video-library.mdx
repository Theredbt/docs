SaveMate's video library lets you save detected videos for later viewing, track what you've watched, and access your collection from any device.

## Saving videos

When SaveMate detects a stream, you can save it to your library with one click. Each saved video stores:

- **Title** — The video title from the page or stream metadata
- **Thumbnail** — A preview image
- **Source link** — The original page URL for easy return
- **Hash** — A unique identifier for deduplication

## Library limits

| Plan | Saved videos |
|------|-------------|
| **Free** | Up to 10 videos |
| **Professional** | Unlimited |

<Note>
  When you reach the free plan limit of 10 saved videos, you'll need to remove existing entries or [upgrade to Professional](/billing/plans) to save more.
</Note>

## Accessing your library

View your saved videos at [savemate.io/videos](https://savemate.io/videos) after signing in. The library provides:

- **Grid view** — Browse your videos with thumbnail previews
- **Search** — Find videos by title
- **Sort** — Order by date saved, title, or other criteria
- **Pagination** — Efficiently browse large collections
- **Direct links** — Click any video to return to its original source

## Cross-device access

Your video library syncs across all devices where you're logged into SaveMate. Save a video on your desktop and access it from your laptop, tablet, or phone through the web app.

<Info>
  Cross-device sync is a **Professional** feature. Free users can access their library from the device where they saved the video.
