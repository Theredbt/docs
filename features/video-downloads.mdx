## HLS stream downloads

For HLS (m3u8) streams, SaveMate handles the complexity of downloading segmented video:

1. Parses the HLS manifest to identify all video segments
2. Downloads segments concurrently for maximum speed
3. Combines segments into a single continuous file
4. Optionally converts to your preferred container format

HLS downloads support:
- **Concurrent threading** — Multiple segments download in parallel
- **Resume capability** — Interrupted downloads can be retried
- **Separate audio/video** — Automatically combines separate audio and video tracks
- **Live streams** — Record ongoing live streams (Professional plan)

## Download limits

**Free users:**
- Unlimited downloads at 720p and below
- 3 HD downloads per day (1080p and above)
- Daily limit resets at midnight

**Professional users:**
- Unlimited downloads at all qualities
- No daily limits

<Tip>
  The HD download limit is tracked per device. If you're logged in, it's tied to your account to prevent quota abuse across devices.
