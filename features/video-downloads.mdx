## HLS & DASH stream downloads

For HLS (m3u8) and DASH (mpd) streams, SaveMate handles the complexity of downloading segmented video:

1. Parses the manifest to identify all video and audio segments
2. Downloads segments concurrently for maximum speed
3. Combines segments into a single continuous file
4. Optionally converts to your preferred container format

Key capabilities:
- **Concurrent threading** — Multiple segments download in parallel for faster completion
- **Resume capability** — Interrupted downloads can be retried
- **Separate audio/video** — Automatically combines separate audio and video tracks into one file
- **Adaptive quality** — Choose from all available quality variants in the manifest
- **Live streams** — Record ongoing live streams (Professional plan)

## Progressive video downloads

For direct video files (MP4, WebM, MKV, etc.), SaveMate downloads the file directly. File sizes are shown upfront when available from HTTP headers.

## Download limits

**Free users:**
- Unlimited downloads at 720p and below
- 3 HD downloads per day (1080p and above)
- Daily limit resets at midnight

**Professional users:**
- Unlimited downloads at all qualities
- No daily limits

<Tip>
  The HD download limit is tracked per device. If you're logged in, it's tied to your account to prevent quota abuse across devices.

## Download settings

Customize download behavior from the extension options page:

- **Download management** — Enable browser download API integration for better control over file naming and save location
- **Download path** — Set a custom folder prefix for downloads (e.g., `SaveMate/` to organize files)
- **File naming** — Files are automatically named with deduplication (adding a number suffix if a file already exists)

<Info>
  The download management feature requires an optional browser permission that is requested at runtime when you enable it.
