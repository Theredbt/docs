SaveMate is designed with privacy as a core principle. Here's exactly what the extension does and doesn't do with your data.

## Local-first processing

All video detection, downloading, and format conversion happens entirely in your browser. SaveMate does not upload your video data to any external server for processing.

| Operation | Where it happens |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Stream detection | Your browser (network API monitoring) |
| Video downloading | Your browser (direct to disk) |
| Format conversion | Your browser (WebAssembly) |
| Audio extraction | Your browser (WebAssembly) |
| Cloud sync upload | Browser to your chosen provider (Google Drive, Dropbox, S3, R2) |

## Data collection

### What SaveMate does NOT collect

- Browsing history or visited URLs
- Video content or downloaded files
- Personal information beyond your account details
- Analytics or tracking data
- Keystroke or form input data

### What SaveMate stores locally

The extension stores settings and detection data in your browser's local storage:

- **Extension settings** — Format preferences, download path, blocked sites, minimum file size
- **Detected streams** — Temporarily cached metadata (title, thumbnail, quality info) for the current tab. Cleared when you close the tab
- **Saved video library** — Video metadata (title, URL, thumbnail) for your cloud library — not the video files themselves
- **Authentication state** — Session token for logged-in users

### What SaveMate sends to our servers

When you have an account and are logged in:

- **Authentication** — Session-based login (email, encrypted password hash)
- **Saved video metadata** — Title, source URL, and thumbnail URL when you save a video to your library
- **Cloud upload metadata** — File name, size, and status for cloud sync tracking
- **Bug reports** — Only when you explicitly submit a report through the extension

## Cloud storage security

### OAuth providers (Google Drive, Dropbox)

- SaveMate uses industry-standard OAuth 2.0 for authorization
- Your Google/Dropbox password is never shared with SaveMate
- You can revoke access at any time from your Google or Dropbox account settings
- SaveMate only requests the minimum permissions needed to upload files to a dedicated folder
- OAuth tokens are stored encrypted on SaveMate's servers and refreshed automatically

### API key providers (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2)

- Your access keys are transmitted over HTTPS and stored encrypted on SaveMate's servers
- We recommend creating a dedicated IAM user with minimal write-only permissions (see the [AWS S3 setup guide](/guides/setup-aws-s3))
- You can rotate keys at any time and update them in SaveMate

## Extension permissions

SaveMate requests only the permissions required for its functionality:

| Permission | Why it's needed |
|------------|----------------|
| **Read and change data on websites** | Monitor network requests to detect video streams |
| **Downloads** | Save downloaded files to your computer (optional, enabled in settings) |
| **Storage** | Save extension settings and cached detection data locally |

SaveMate does not request permissions for:
- Reading your bookmarks
- Accessing your browsing history
- Reading or modifying cookies
- Accessing other extensions' data

## Payment security

All payment processing is handled by [Stripe](https://stripe.com), a PCI DSS Level 1 certified payment processor. SaveMate never sees, stores, or processes your credit card number. Payment information is entered directly into Stripe's secure forms.

## Extension verification

SaveMate is published on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lejgkageoahacjmljeogapbkhbfldigd) and has been reviewed by Google's security team. The extension uses a strict Content Security Policy:

```
script-src 'self'; object-src 'self'
```

This prevents any external code from running within the extension.

## Account deletion

You can delete your SaveMate account at any time from [Account Security settings](https://savemate.io/settings/security). Account deletion:

- Permanently removes all personal data from our servers
- Removes your saved video library
- Cancels any active subscription
- Is irreversible

<Warning>Account deletion cannot be undone. Make sure to download any data you want to keep before deleting your account.</Warning>
